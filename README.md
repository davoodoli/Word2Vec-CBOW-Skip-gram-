# Word2Vec Word Embedding Project

## Overview
This project allows users to create a Word2Vec model from a text file and find the top 3 words most similar to a user-provided word from the document. The project is built using Streamlit for the user interface, and Gensim's Word2Vec for word embedding.

## Features
- **Word2Vec Model Creation**: Users can upload a `.txt` file and create a Word2Vec model based on the document's content.
- **Word Similarity**: Users can input a word from the uploaded document and get the top 3 most similar words using the trained Word2Vec model.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface for interacting with the Word2Vec model.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davoodoli/Word2Vec-CBOW-Skip-gram-.git
